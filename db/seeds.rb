He concludes, based upon the knowledge that the evolutionary ancestors of humans originated from the seas, we, as humans today, inevitably share various capabilities that allows us to flourish in water. Specifically, he compares humans to species that still inhabit the oceans, and takes examples of people who freedive, in order to compare both's biological traits. If you ever wondered why water is such a source of happiness to the majority of humans, you'll definitely find some answers here.",
