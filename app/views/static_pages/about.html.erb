  <h2 class="text-center header-form">About us</h1>
  <p>Bookaround.org was born as a project from the Bootcamp in Web Development at Le Wagon, in Brussels (Belgium). The initial team was formed by <a href="https://github.com/shmoulhorn" target="_blank">Samuel Horn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Mystic77" target="_blank">Jasper Hendrickx</a>, <a href="https://github.com/M-Gryphon" target="_blank">Greggory Griffin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vondersam" target="_blank">me</a>, and we worked on the prototype for three weeks in order to present it to the public for the first time on the 16th of December 2016. After that, I continued the project on my own.</p>
  <p>Even though this is a super-lean-one-man-startup, I believe in the continuous development of happiness, so expect new features, fixes and improvements every Monday morning, Norwegian time.</p>
  <p>Also, please feel free to <a href="emailto:samuelyret@gmail.com">contact me</a> with any feedback, critics, ideas of things that can be improved, etc. I'll be happy to hear from you.</p>
  <p>Happy reading!</p>
